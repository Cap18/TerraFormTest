### Infrastructure Components

1. **Virtual Network (VNet):** Provides network isolation.
2. **Subnets:** Distributes resources across multiple availability zones for high availability.
3. **Network Security Groups (NSGs):** Manages inbound and outbound traffic.
4. **Application Gateway:** Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances and provides SSL termination.
5. **Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS):** Ensures high availability and scalability of the microservice.
6. **Azure SQL Database:** Manages the database with high availability.
7. **Azure Monitor:** Monitors and logs infrastructure performance.
8. **Managed Identities and RBAC:** Ensures secure access management.
9. **Storage Account:** Stores logs and backups.
    
11. ### Explanation

1. **Virtual Network and Subnets:** Creates a VNet with public and private subnets to separate resources and ensure network isolation.
2. **Network Security Groups:** Defines NSGs for public and private subnets to control inbound and outbound traffic.
3. **Application Gateway:** Provides a highly available entry point for incoming traffic with SSL termination and load balancing.
4. **Virtual Machine Scale Set:** Ensures that the microservice can scale automatically based on demand.
5. **Azure SQL Database:** Provides a managed database service with high availability.
6. **Storage Account:** Stores logs and backups, ensuring that logs are available for monitoring and auditing.
7. **Azure Monitor and Log Profile:** Configures Azure Monitor for logging and sets up a log profile for auditing activities.

### Best Practices

- **Modularity:** Each component is defined separately for better readability and maintainability.
- **Tags:** Tags are used for resource management and cost tracking.
- **Security:** Uses NSGs
